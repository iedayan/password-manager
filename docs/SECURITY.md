# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

Lok Password Manager implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect user data and ensure zero-knowledge architecture.

## Security Features

### üîê Encryption
- **Algorithm**: Fernet (AES 128 in CBC mode with HMAC-SHA256)
- **Key Management**: Environment-based encryption keys
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Passwords encrypted client-side before transmission
- **Key Rotation**: Supported through environment variable updates

### üõ°Ô∏è Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: TOTP with backup codes
- **Master Key Verification**: Additional layer for sensitive operations
- **Account Lockout**: Automatic lockout after failed attempts

### üö® Security Monitoring
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Security events, access logs, audit trails
- **Breach Detection**: Integration with HaveIBeenPwned API
- **Password Strength Analysis**: Advanced entropy and pattern detection
- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based request throttling with automatic blocking

### üîí Data Protection
- **Database Encryption**: Encrypted password storage
- **Secure Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries with SQLAlchemy

## Security Architecture

### Zero-Knowledge Implementation
```
Client ‚Üí [Encrypt Password] ‚Üí Server ‚Üí [Store Encrypted] ‚Üí Database
Client ‚Üê [Decrypt Password] ‚Üê Server ‚Üê [Retrieve Encrypted] ‚Üê Database
```

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User Login ‚Üí JWT Token
2. Sensitive Operation ‚Üí Master Key Verification
3. 2FA Enabled ‚Üí TOTP/Backup Code Required
4. Failed Attempts ‚Üí Account Lockout
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Encryption
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-fernet-key-here

# JWT
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-here

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db

# Security
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-flask-secret-here
```

### Security Headers
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`

## Threat Model

### Protected Against
- ‚úÖ SQL Injection
- ‚úÖ XSS Attacks
- ‚úÖ CSRF Attacks
- ‚úÖ Clickjacking
- ‚úÖ Brute Force Attacks
- ‚úÖ Data Breaches (encrypted storage)
- ‚úÖ Man-in-the-Middle (HTTPS required)
- ‚úÖ Session Hijacking (secure tokens)

### Assumptions
- Server infrastructure is secure
- HTTPS is properly configured
- Environment variables are protected
- Database access is restricted

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, keys)
2. **Validate all inputs** before processing
3. **Use parameterized queries** for database operations
4. **Implement proper error handling** without information leakage
5. **Follow principle of least privilege**

### For Deployment
1. **Use HTTPS everywhere** (TLS 1.2+)
2. **Secure environment variables** (use secrets management)
3. **Regular security updates** for dependencies
4. **Monitor security logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Implement backup and recovery** procedures

### For Users
1. **Use strong master passwords** (12+ characters)
2. **Enable two-factor authentication**
3. **Keep backup codes secure**
4. **Regular password updates** for compromised accounts
5. **Use unique passwords** for each service

## Incident Response

### Security Event Detection
- Failed login attempts monitoring
- Suspicious IP address tracking
- Unusual access pattern detection
- Breach notification integration

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Block suspicious IPs
2. **Investigation**: Review security logs
3. **Containment**: Disable affected accounts
4. **Recovery**: Reset credentials if needed
5. **Prevention**: Update security measures

## Compliance

### Standards Alignment
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common vulnerabilities
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management approach
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security controls implementation
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy compliance

### Audit Trail
- All password access logged
- Security events tracked
- User activity monitoring
- Administrative actions recorded

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run security tests
pytest tests/security/ -v

# Check for vulnerabilities
bandit -r backend/

# Dependency scanning
safety check
```

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing recommended quarterly
- Code review for security issues
- Infrastructure security assessment
- Social engineering awareness training

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security@lok.security with details
3. Include steps to reproduce
4. Allow reasonable time for response
5. Follow responsible disclosure practices
